# Rover

Rover simulation implemented in Scala. Basic akka. Kinda fun.

## Desc

When deployed to a specific location on Moon, rover accepts move commands "LRFB...". Rotating Left(L) or Right(R) or moving Forwards(F) or Bacwards(B).
Rover's location is determined by its current coordinates (x, y) and orientation north/east/south/west.
